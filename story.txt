There once was a flughafen in Raesfeld.
It had an amazing biergarten.
That's where Ratskeller were sitting and eating Bratwurst.
Inconsequentially, a hund was gnawing on some stale brot nearby.
Every morning, Dr. Melhase drove in a pink Porsche, listening to Rammstein.
Needless to say, it annoys the Eltz's when she drives by their Schloss. 
It antagonized them so much, they moved to Berlin.
